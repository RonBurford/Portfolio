<h4>
  My name is Ronald Burford,<br><br>
  Currently, I am a Highly Energetic, Membership Services professional, that brings teamwork,  empowerment, dedication, and fun, to my environment. I have served as a Liaison, using Microsoft Office to enter data, track information, take payments, and work closely with children, families, and community partners, housed at the Boys & Girls Club Dane County locations for over seven years.</br></br>Each year I take 2 to 3 training relevant to the field I am in at the time. Working to keep my skills sharp, I have taken advantage of the YWeb Career Academy, to advance my knowledge in programing and design. I am confident that my skills and experience has prepared me to perform well in a fast-paced, challenging, and team oriented workplace.)</br></br>

  It is with high excitement I welcome the opportunity to meet face to face and discuss further. In the mean time, here's a link to some of my other work.</br></br>

Sincerely </br></br>
Ronald Burford.
